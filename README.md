# Portfolio Activity #1 - Botium Toys

I was given an audit scope and goals from this fictional company called *Botium Toys*.  

The summary reads: 
```
Botium Toys: Audit scope and goals

Summary: Perform an audit of Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program. The audit needs
to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices. The
audit is meant to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities found that are
classified as “high risk,” and present an overall strategy for improving the security
posture of the organization. The audit team needs to document their findings, provide
remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders.

I will need to complete two tasks:  
   1. Controls Assessment
   2. Compliance Checklist

These two tasks will be seperated into two different `Branches` in `Main` and they are labeled accordingly.  

The purpose of this assignment is to:  

> 1. Demonstrate my ability to select, rate, and explain the specific controls and compliance regulations and standards that Botium Toys need to implement to mitigate risks to people and assets.
> 2. Display my newly acquired knowledge in _Markdown_ syntax usage. 

Please begin by reviewing **Controls Assessment** followed by **Compliance Checklist**.
