# Compliance Checklist

> Notes for the readers:
> 
> The checklist was provided to me through the assignement. I was then required to go through the list and notate if the fictional company need to meet any of the regulations. If notated, I was required to write an explanation for my decisions.

## Checklist

- [ ] The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)

  The FERC-NERC regulation applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. Organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. Organizations are legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards (CIP) defined by the FERC.

  Explanation: NA

- [x] General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

  GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. citizens’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. Additionally, if a breach occurs and a E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed within 72 hours of the incident.

  ```
  Explanation:

  Botium Toys has online sales which means that they conduct business and collect personal information such as credit card, address, name, etc., worldwide. That said, they will need to adhere to the GDPR.
  ```

- [x] Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

  PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment.

  ```
  Explanation:  Similar to my explanation for the GDPR, since Botium Toys collect credit card information for their transactions, they need to adhere to PCI DSS as well.  
  ```

- [ ] The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

  HIPAA is a federal law established in 1996 to protect U.S. patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. Organizations have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach.

  Explanation:

- [ ] System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)  

  The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels. They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

  ```
  Explanation:  Online users for any website will require the appropriate user to have different access than admins. Botium Toys is not an exception, they need to enforce appropriate user access to mitgate risk and ensure data safety.
