# Controls Assessment
> Notes For The Reader:
> 
> 1. The section *Current Assets* was provided through the assignment as well as *Control Name* and *Control type and explanation* columns located in the table.
> 2. There are a few control sections where I marked it *NA*, that is because they are already implemented and therefore, not needed.

## Current Assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include: 
   - On-premises equipment for in-office business needs  
   - Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
   - Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
   - Internet access
   - Internal network
   - Vendor access management
   - Data center hosting services  
   - Data retention and storage
   - Badge readers
   - Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring 

### Administrative Controls

Control Name | Control type and explanation | Needs to be implemented (X) |  Priority 
--- | --- | --- | --- |
Least Privilege | Preventative; reduces risk by making sure vendors and non-authorized staff only have access to the assets/data they need to do their jobs | X | High
Disaster recovery plans | Corrective; business continuity to ensure systems are able to run in the event of an incident/there is limited to no loss of productivity downtime/impact to system components, including: computer room environment (air conditioning, power supply, etc.); hardware (servers, employee equipment); connectivity (internal network, wireless); applications (email, electronic data); data and restoration | X | High
Password policies | Preventative; establish password strength rules to improve security/reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attack techniques | X | Low
Access control policies | Preventative; increase confidentiality and integrity of data | X | High
Account management policies | Preventative; reduce attack surface and limit overall impact from disgruntled/former employees | X | Medium 
Separation of duties | Preventative; ensure no one has so much access that they can abuse the system for personal gain | X | Medium 

### Technical Controls 

Control Name | Control type and explanation | Needs to be implemented (X) |  Priority 
--- | --- | --- | --- |
Firewall | Preventative; firewalls are already in place to filter unwanted/malicious traffic from entering internal network | X | High 
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) | Detective; allows IT team to identify possible intrusions (e.g., anomalous traffic) quickly | NA | NA
Encryption | Deterrent; makes confidential information/data more secure (e.g., website payment transactions) | X | High 
Backups | Corrective; supports ongoing productivity in the case of an event; aligns to the disaster recovery plan | X | High 
Password management system | Corrective; password recovery, reset, lock out notifications | X | Low
Antivirus (AV) software | Corrective; detect and quarantine known threats | X | Medium 
Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention | Preventative/corrective; required for legacy systems to identify and mitigate potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities | X | Medium 

### Physical Controls

Control Name | Control type and explanation | Needs to be implemented (X) |  Priority 
--- | --- | --- | --- |
Time-controlled safe | Deterrent; reduce attack surface/impact of physical threats | X | Low
Adequate lighting | Deterrent; limit "hiding" places to deter threats | X | Low
CCTV | Preventative/detective; can reduce risk of certain events; can be used after event for investigation | X | High 
Locking cabinets (for network gear) | Preventative; increase integrity by preventing unauthorized personnel/individuals from physically accessing/modifying network infrastructure gear | X | Low
Signage indicating alarm service provider | Deterrent; makes the likelihood of a successful attack seem low | X | Low
Locks | Preventative; physical and digital assets are more secure | X | Medium
Fire detection and prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.) | Detective/Preventative; detect fire in the toy storeâ€™s physical location to prevent damage to inventory, servers, etc. | X | Medium
